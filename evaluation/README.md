# Evaluation — prototype

**Not an official challenge release.** Real manifest adapters, held-out reference data and the final scoring protocol are pending.

## Metrics

Balanced accuracy (mean recall across configured classes), macro F1 and overall accuracy, reported as percentages. Balanced accuracy is the proposed primary metric, pending organizer confirmation. Every configured class must occur in the reference split; otherwise this prototype rejects the reference rather than silently changing the metric.

## Local example

Python 3.9 or newer; no third-party dependencies. From the repository root:

```bash
python3 evaluation/scoring.py --input examples --output outputs/example
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The included data is synthetic. The sample predictions are perfect and should yield 100 for every reported metric. Generated aggregate scores are written to `outputs/example/scores.json`.

## Proposed submission format

A ZIP with `predictions.json` at its root. The JSON is a list of records, each with exactly `id` and `label`. IDs and values are nonempty strings; every expected ID must appear exactly once. Missing IDs, extra IDs, duplicate keys and unknown values are rejected. Order is irrelevant.

See [the synthetic submission](../examples/res/predictions.json) and [synthetic reference](../examples/ref/reference.json). The reference schema contains `task`, `records` and `classes`. It is an internal prototype format, not an assertion about the native dataset format.

## CodaBench integration

The scoring directory contains `metadata.yaml` and `scoring.py`. At runtime it reads `/app/input/ref/reference.json` and `/app/input/res/predictions.json`, then writes `/app/output/scores.json`. Store real private references only in the organizer reference-data package, never in this repository or a public starting kit.

Test and challenge servers: **coming soon**. Test against the real baseline and malformed submissions on CodaBench before launch. This repository alone does not create a competition or enforce input-modality restrictions.

## Protocol decisions

See [the task specification](../docs/task.md) and [draft rules](../docs/rules.md).
